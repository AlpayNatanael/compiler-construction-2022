# Project 

**Part 2 of the report**, worth 15%, will be a project. You can choose between any of the two projects below. If you have your own ideas about a project get in touch.

**Deadlines:** 
- Sunday March 20, by sending me an email with a link to the pdf of your report containing a description of your project. (I am happy to extend the deadline by one week, but I don't want to force you to work over the spring break.)
- Final deadline at the end of the exam's week.

Also get in touch and show me your work between the two deadlines.

## Project: Explaining a Compiler

Choose a programming language (such as C) and a compiler (such as gcc) and compile example programs to assembly and explain in some detail
- how the compilation works and 
- how the assembly program is executed on the machine.

For the first deadline, you need to have made a choice of programming language and compiler and show me a program in the source language and the target language (assembly, JVM, ...) that you want to explain.

## Project: Creating Your Own Programming Language

Writing a compiler for a full scale programming language is out of the scope of this course. But it should be possible, for example, for you to invent your own [esoteric programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esoteric_programming_language). You may also want to think about a domain specific language, for example, to mechanize some boring homework you may have got in some other class. The task then is to design a grammar for a language and write an interpreter.

For the first deadline, you need to describe to me the outlines of a language specification of your programming language. Start with a minimal language and plan for possible extensions.
