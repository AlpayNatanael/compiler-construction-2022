## Part 1: Lexing, Finite Automata, Regular Expressions

In the first week we find that automata are a good specification language to specify algorithms searching for patterns in text.

- L1.1: [Searching for Strings](https://hackmd.io/@alexhkurz/Sk555wUlu). Don't forget the [Homework](https://hackmd.io/@alexhkurz/rycnvMvgu). **Excursion:** [*Why do Java and Python not have goto statements?*](https://hackmd.io/@alexhkurz/rJ5wS-0f8), which shows how to implement automata in imperative languages with and without goto.

- L1.2: [Introduction to Automata and Haskell](https://hackmd.io/@alexhkurz/HylLKujCP). Practice what you have learned with this [Homework](homework-1.2.md).

In the second week we go one level up, from automata as a specification language for search algorithms to regular expressions as a specification language for automata (and languages).

- L2.1: [Composing Automata (with Homework)](https://hackmd.io/@alexhkurz/ryV_FU7XI).

- L2.2: [Regular Expressions](https://hackmd.io/@alexhkurz/HkoNj8mmU) ... [Homework](https://hackmd.io/@alexhkurz/S1EVYe7bO) ...  

- L3.1: We reviewed the NFAs and regular expressions for the languages of Exercises 2.3.4 and 2.5.3.  We looked at the conversion of NFA to DFA in the [Introduction to Automata and Haskell](https://hackmd.io/@alexhkurz/HylLKujCP). See the highlighted assessed homework in there.

- L3.2: We went through the monad parts of the [Introduction to Automata and Haskell](https://hackmd.io/@alexhkurz/HylLKujCP) (look for the sections on partial DFAs and on NFAs). I also link a writeup from last semester, [a very short introduction to monads](https://hackmd.io/@alexhkurz/ByD5fgecY), but it contains more on monads than we covered today (recommended as background).

This finishes what I consider the most important aspects of DFA, NFA, and regular expressions: **(1)** How to use DFA to search for/recognise patterns of strings (=languages) in a text. **(2)** How to use regular expressions to specify languages. **(3)** How to translate regular expressions to NFA and how to translate NFA to DFA. To summarize:

        reg.exp. ~> NFA ~> DFA ~> code

If we had time the next steps in the story of finite automata would be the following. **(a)** For every DFA there is a regular expression. This completes the proof the famous Kleene theorem that regular expressions and finite automata are equivalent in the sense that they recognise the same languages (called regular languages). **(b)** For every DFA there is an equivalent minimal DFA. This is important as the minimal DFA is the most efficient implementation (in terms of space) of a regular language. 

## Part 2: Parsing and Context-Free Grammars

- L4.1: [Assignment 1](https://hackmd.io/@alexhkurz/HJ4KjezfO).

<!--
- L4.2: [Introduction to Shift-Reduce Parsing](https://hackmd.io/@alexhkurz/rk5PsF2EI) ... handwritten [notes](https://github.com/alexhkurz/compiler-construction-2021/blob/master/Sources/Notes-from-the-lecture-intro-shift-reduce.pdf) from the lecture ...
- L5.1: Introduction to [Shift/reduce and reduce/reduce conflicts](https://hackmd.io/@alexhkurz/SJx6T5R48) and the  [LALR(1) parser](https://hackmd.io/@alexhkurz/SJ4sbGyrU) generated by BNFC/Happy. 
- L5.2: Question and Answer Session.
- L6.1: To put the theory we have seen so far in context, I reviewed the [Chomsky Hierarchy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=224plb3bCog) and gave a prove of the undecidability of the [Halting Problem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=macM_MtS_w4&t=0s).  In the comments to the linked videos you find more on this topic, all highly recommended. I also enjoyed watching [Halting Problem in Python](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r__GZ7ubU0M). Here are my [handwritten notes](https://github.com/alexhkurz/compiler-construction-2021/blob/master/Sources/Notes-from-the-lecture-chomsky-hierarchy-halting-problem.pdf) from the lecture. In the afternoon lecture, we also looked at ["The tourist saw the astronomer with the telescope"](https://github.com/alexhkurz/compiler-construction-2021/blob/master/Sources/The_tourist_saw_the_astronomer_with_the_telescope.pdf) from the point of view of shift-reduce conflicts.
- L6.2: We talked about the rightmost column in the table summarising the [Chomsky hierarchy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chomsky_hierarchy#The_hierarchy). Read Chapter 3.9 to 4.3 of [IPL](http://www.cse.chalmers.se/edu/year/2012/course/DAT150/lectures/plt-book.pdf). Then we returned to Assignment 1 and reviewed some examples of how to [debug a grammar](https://hackmd.io/@alexhkurz/SkXrrBuSI). 

## Part 3: Type Checking

**Stocktaking:** We have covered the first three chapters of the book [Implementing Programming Languages](http://www.cse.chalmers.se/edu/year/2012/course/DAT150/lectures/plt-book.pdf). This could be a good time to read through these chapters to consolidate what we learned. We will now turn to Chapter 4 of [IPL](http://www.cse.chalmers.se/edu/year/2012/course/DAT150/lectures/plt-book.pdf). Reasons why type checking is important:

- The copy language is not context free.
- Compile-time errors are cheaper than run-time errors.
- Information in the types can be used to produce more efficient code.
- Types can be used to disambiguate over-loaded operations.

For us there is another one, namely that type checking can be seen as "interpretation at compile time". Everything we learn about typechecking will help us to understand interpretation better.

- L7.1: Working towards Assignment 3, the [Type Checker for CPP](http://www.grammaticalframework.org/ipl-book/assignments/assignment2/assignment2.html). Main source is Chapter 4 of the book. *Homework:* Read Chapter 4.1 to 4.3 of [IPL](http://www.cse.chalmers.se/edu/year/2012/course/DAT150/lectures/plt-book.pdf). 

- L7.2: [Assignment 2](https://github.com/ChapmanCPSC/compiler-assignments/blob/master/Typechecker/). Read Chapter 4.4 to 4.6 of [IPL](http://www.cse.chalmers.se/edu/year/2012/course/DAT150/lectures/plt-book.pdf).

- L8.1: Revision for midterm.

- L8.2: Midterm in class.

- L9.1 and 9.2: Back to the typechecker. Read Chapter 4.8 of [IPL](http://www.cse.chalmers.se/edu/year/2012/course/DAT150/lectures/plt-book.pdf).

## Part 4: Interpreter

- L10.1: Interpreter and Operational Semantics. Read Chapters 5.1 and 5.2 of [IPL](http://www.cse.chalmers.se/edu/year/2012/course/DAT150/lectures/plt-book.pdf).

- L10.2: Starting [Assignment 3](https://github.com/ChapmanCPSC/compiler-assignments/blob/master/Interpreter/README.md) on the Interpreter.

- L11.1: Read Chapter 5.3 of the book.

- L11.2: Read Chapter 5.4 and 5.5 of the book. [Homework](https://hackmd.io/@alexhkurz/S1wmI_yPO).

- L12.1: Seminar announcement ... Discussion Midterm ... JVM, [IPL](http://www.cse.chalmers.se/edu/year/2012/course/DAT150/lectures/plt-book.pdf), [Slides Chapter 5](https://github.com/alexhkurz/compiler-construction-2021/blob/master/Sources/5-slides-ipl-book.pdf)

## Part 5: Code Generation

[Assignment 4](https://github.com/ChapmanCPSC/compiler-assignments/blob/master/Compiler/README.md).

- L 12.2: [Compiling C++ to WASM](https://github.com/alexhkurz/compiler-construction-2021/blob/master/lecture-12.1.md).

- L 13.1: [Compiling C++ to WASM 2](https://github.com/alexhkurz/compiler-construction-2021/blob/master/lecture-12.2.md).

- L 13.2, 14.1: Continuing with Assignment  4.

- 14.2: **Take some time to fill in the questionnaire.** Review for final. There will be three topics, parsing, typechecking, interpretation. Parsing will be similar to the midterm (but do not forget the concrete syntax trees). The question on typechecking will be based on Chapter 4.5 of [IPL](http://www.cse.chalmers.se/edu/year/2012/course/DAT150/lectures/plt-book.pdf). The question on interpretation will be based on Chapters 5.1 to 5.3. To get an idea of the type of questions, look at the [Practice Test](https://github.com/alexhkurz/compiler-construction-2021/blob/master/Sources/practice-test-3-4.pdf). I will post solutions but first try without looking at the [answers](https://github.com/alexhkurz/compiler-construction-2021/blob/master/Sources/Answers/practice-test-3-4/README.md).

- **Office Hours:** Monday 12 noon: I will answer last questions about the exam.

- **Final Exam:** Tuesday 8am until 11:59pm. I will send out a link to the exam just before 8am on Canvas and the discussion forum.
